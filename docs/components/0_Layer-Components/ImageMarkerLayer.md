# Image Marker Layer

This componernt creates a layer of type "symbol" where the geometries are represented by an image rather than a point.

This would be the typical case of a cutlery icon representing the location of restaurants on the map.
In the catalog example, the location of the WhereGroup headquarters is represented by the company logo.
