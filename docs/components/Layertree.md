# Layer Tree

This component provides a layer tree that shows the user the layers available on the map. 
The layers can be toggled on or off on the sidebar, and if the option is enabled, the user can also edit some basic properties of each layer, such as the color of the features, the radius of the point, the thickness of the line and others, depending on the type of the layer in question. 

The component also allows grouping the layers into "folders" (LayerListFolder).
