# Quick Start Guide

This quick start guide is designed like a workshop to walk you through the essential steps of building your very own map application with MapComponents.

You'll learn how to implement a vector tile map, sidebar, topbar, navigation tools, print tool,
add layers, manage your layers with a layertree, and explore feature properties to provide detailed information about specific map elements.

### 0. Application Initialization

For a quick project start you can use the MapComponents Vite Template:

```bash
npx degit mapcomponents/template my-map-app
```

And start developing:

```bash
cd my-map-app
yarn
yarn dev
```

<img src={require("/img/init_app_template.png").default} width="1000" />
